# Vesting contract

Vestign contract is build with Solidity and tested with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/).
It allows assigning and distributing `AbramisBrama` (fake token) between given addresses and has logic to claim tokens over specified number of periods over vesting time.
All those values can be configured when contract is created. 


### How to run

Project can be tested by running tests or deploying a Solidity contract

```
npm run test:latest
```
